I just discovered the the tilde, `~`, in normal mode will switch the case of whatever letter the cursor is on. 

Also `g~w` will switch case on the word you're on, `g~g~` will do the whole line.

When you need an all caps word it might be easier just to type a lower case word, and then have Vim capitlize it for you after the fact.

What does it do with nubmers? Hold on a sec...123...nothing.
